## Hi there! 👋🏼

**My name is Jesse Markowitz** and I'm a data scientist with a background in science education and a recent graduate of the Flatiron School. I taught for the past 10 years, the last 6 in the New York City public schools teaching middle school science. I loved designing projects for my students that let them take ownership of their learning through hands-on experiences. I also gained a lot of experience and skill with breaking down technical concepts for non-technical audiences. 

I became a data scientist because I’m passionate about creative problem solving for public good. I want to apply my love of science and data to challenges where I can have an impact and help others.

### What I'm up to:

- 🔭 I’m currently working through [Public Policy Analytics](https://urbanspatial.github.io/PublicPolicyAnalytics/index.html) to learn more about the intersection of data science and public good. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, SQL, and AWS
- 👯 Open to collaborate on data and machine learning projects that have a social impact
- 💬 Ask me about neural networks with Keras/Tensorflow
- 🗽 NYC-based
- Catch me 🚲 cycling, ⛺️ camping, or  🧗🏻‍ rock climbing when the weather's nice and playing 🎻 🪕 music when I have to stay indoors!
